A pair of knobs with adjustable tapers.

A
_[taper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentiometer#Resistanceâ€“position_relationship:_"taper")_
is a
_[transfer function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_function)_
that defines the relationship
between the position of the knob
and the device's output value.

_Tapers_ can produce
[linear, J-shaped, or S-shaped]({{ '/technical/curves/' | relative_url }})
tapers,
as well as inverted J and S tapers.

**NOTE:**
    The [sigmoid function]({{ '/technical/sigmoid/' | relative_url }})
    that generates the tapers
    cannot accept _LEVEL_ and _TAPER_ values
    outside the range of the knobs.
    If a _CV_ signal would modulate a value
    beyond the associated knob's range,
    _Tapers_ clamps the modulated value
    to the knob's range.

## Controls
- **LEVEL:**
    Selects a position
    along the transfer function
    defined by the _TAPER_ panel.

- **TAPER:**
    The curvature
    of the transfer function
    applied to the _LEVEL_ knob.

    The center position
    produces a linear taper.
    Rotation away from the center
    increases the the curvature of the transfer function.
    Counterclockwise rotation
    inverts the shape of the curve.

    The shape switch **(S / J)**
    selects the general [shape]({{ '/technical/curves/' | relative_url }})
    of the transfer function.

- **UNI / BI:**
    The voltage range of the output signal.
    0 to 10V (UNI)
    or -5 to 5V (BI).

## Ports
- **OUT:**
    The output voltage,
    determined by applying the transfer function
    to the position of the _LEVEL_ knob.

- **CV:**
    Control voltage signal that modulates the associated knob.
    The modulation is calibrated so that:
    - A 0V _CV_ signal yields the value of the knob.
    - A 5V _CV_ signal yields the value
        as if the knob were rotated 50%
        clockwise
        of its actual position.
    - A -5V _CV_ signal yields the value
        as if the knob were rotated 50%
        counterclockwise
        of its actual position.

    Each _CV_ port
        is accompanied by a small *attenuverter* (**- +**) knob,
        which adjusts the strength and direction
        of the the _CV_ signal's effect
        on the modulated knob.
