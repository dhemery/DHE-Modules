Transforms its input signal by offsetting, scaling, squaring, and cubing it.

*Cubic* calculates the function:

- *y* = *ax<sup>3</sup>* + *bx<sup>2</sup>* + *cx<sup>1</sup>* + *dx<sup>0</sup>*

which
(because *x<sup>1</sup>* = *x* and *x<sup>0</sup>* = 1)
can be written as:

- *y* = *ax<sup>3</sup>* + *bx<sup>2</sup>* + *cx* + *d*

Take care when applying Cubic to an audio signal.

**WARNING:**
Cubic can emit voltages **far outside** the safe
audio range (-5 to 5V).
See the [usage guide](#using-cubic) for details.

**WARNING:**
The _x<sup>2</sup>_ and _x<sup>0</sup>_ knobs
can generate
a **very large DC bias.**
See the [usage guide](#using-cubic) for details.

## Controls
- **IN:**
    The gain to apply to the **IN** signal
    to produce the value of *x* for the equation.
    The range is 0 to 2.

- **x<sup>3</sup>:**
    The amount of *x* cubed to add to *y*
    —
    the *a* coefficient for the *ax<sup>3</sup>* term of the equation.
    The range is -2 to 2.

- **x<sup>2</sup>:**
    The amount of *x* squared to add to *y*
    —
    the *b* coefficient for the *bx<sup>2</sup>* term of the equation.
    The range is -2 to 2.

- **x<sup>1</sup>:**
    The amount of *x* to add to *y*
    —
    the *c* coefficient for the *cx<sup>1</sup>* term of the equation.
    This acts as a attenuverter
    with a range of -2 to 2.

- **x<sup>0</sup>:**
    The constant to add to *y*
    —
    the *d* coefficient for the *dx<sup>0</sup>* term of the equation.
    This acts as a DC offset
    with a range of -10 to 10V.

- **OUT:**
    The gain to apply to *y*
    before sending it to the **OUT** port.
    The range is 0 to 2.

## Ports
- **IN:**
    The input signal to transform.

- **OUT:**
    The transformed signal.

- **CV:**
    Control voltage signal that modulates the associated knob.
    The modulation is calibrated so that:
    - A 0V _CV_ signal yields the value of the knob.
    - A 5V _CV_ signal yields the value
        as if the knob were rotated 50%
        clockwise
        of its actual position.
    - A -5V _CV_ signal yields the value
        as if the knob were rotated 50%
        counterclockwise
        of its actual position.

## Using Cubic

- Cubic excels at transforming a simple modulation signal,
    such as a sawtooth or triangle LFO signal,
    into something more interesting.
- With all other controls set to 0,
    _x<sup>0</sup>_
    generates a constant voltage
    with a range of -10 to 10V.
- With all other controls set to 0,
    _x<sup>1</sup>_
    acts as an attenuverter
    with a gain range of -2 to 2.
- Applied to an audio signal,
    _x<sup>3</sup>_
   generates mellow harmonics.
- By default,
    all of Cubic's controls are set to 0.
    While this makes the default patch essentially useless,
    it does make it easier
    to set any control to 0.
- **WARNING:**
    Cubic can generate voltages
    **far outside** the safe audio range of -5 to 5V.
    If you apply Cubic to an audio signal,
    adjust the _IN_ and _OUT_ gain
    to keep the output signal
    in the safe audio range.
- **WARNING:**
    The _x<sup>2</sup>_ and _x<sup>0</sup>_ controls
    can generate
    a **signficant DC bias.**
    If you apply
    _x<sup>2</sup>_ and _x<sup>0</sup>_
    to an audio signal,
    adjust the _IN_ and _OUT_ gain
    to keep the output signal
    in the safe audio range (-5 to 5V).
    The _x<sup>2</sup>_ and _x<sup>0</sup>_ controls
    can each,
    to some extent,
    compensate for the DC bias
    generated by the other.
