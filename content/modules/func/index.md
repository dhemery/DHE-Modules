    - _ADD_ offsets the signal by adding the selected voltage to it.
    - _MULT_ scales the signal by multiplying it by the selected amount.

    This switch also selects
    an appropriate set of ranges
    for the function.
    See the _RANGE_ button, below.

- **KNOB:**
    Selects the amount
    to offset or scale
    the input signal.

- **RANGE (button):**
    Selects the range of the knob.

    The ranges depend on the function selected by the _ADD / MULT_ switch.
    For each function,
    this button cycles through several ranges.

    - _ADD_ ranges:
        - 0–5
        - ±5
        - 0–10
        - ±10
    - _MULT_ ranges:

        - 0–2 (gain)
        - ±2
