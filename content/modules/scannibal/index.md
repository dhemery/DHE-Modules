A scanned sequencer
that offers flexible, precise control
over the individual steps.

DHE Modules includes three _Scannibal_ modules:
- _Scannibal 4_ (shown).
- _Scannibal 8._
- _Scannibal 16._

The three modules operate identically, except for the number of steps.

See:

- [Controls](#controls) (below)
- [Operation](#operation) (below)
- [J and S Curves](/technical/curves/)

## Controls

-   [Inputs](#inputs)
-   [Step controls](#step-controls)
-   [Global controls](#global-controls)
-   [Outputs](#outputs)

### Inputs

- The **Φ** input
    is the scanner phase signal
    that drives the module.
    _Scannibal_ maps a 0–10V signal
    to the "phase" range: 0–1.
    Voltages outside of 0–10V
    are "wrapped" into the phase range.

- **A**, **B**, and **C:**
    Three input signals
    that each anchor
    can sample or track.

### Step Controls

- Each step has two "anchors"
    that determine the voltages
    between which the step interpolates.
    When the step phase is 0,
    the step emits the voltage
    reported by the **Φ＝0** anchor.
    When the step phase is 1,
    the step emits the voltage
    reported by the **Φ＝1** anchor.
    When the step phase is between 0 and 1,
    the step interpolates between the anchor voltages
    along a curve specified by the curve controls.

    Each anchor has three controls:

    -   The **MODE** button (the top button)
        determines whether the anchor reports
        a sampled voltage or the current voltage.

        - _SAMPL:_
            The anchor reports
            the voltage that it sampled from its source
            when the step became active.

        - _TRACK:_
            The anchor reports
            the current voltage
            of its source.

    -   The **SOURCE** button (below the **MODE** button)
        specifies where the anchor gets the voltage it reports.
        The possible sources are:

        - The anchor's _LEVEL_ knob.
        - The _A_, _B_, or _C_ input port.
        - The _OUT_ port.

    -   The anchor **LEVEL** knob
        sets the voltage
        of the anchor's _level_ source.
        The range of the knob
        is determined by the global **UNI / BI** range switch.
        This knob is used
        only when _LEVEL_
        is selected as the anchor's _SOURCE._

-   The **[ Φ ]** "phase width" knob
    increases or decreases
    the proportion of the scanner phase
    during which this step is active.
    Turning the knob clockwise
    makes the step active
    during more of the scanner phase.

    Setting a step's phase width to 0
    disables the step.
    Setting all steps' phase widths to 0
    pauses the sequence.

-   The **SHAPE** button
    selects the shape (J or S)
    of the step's interpolation curve.

-   The **CURVE** knob
    sets the curvature
    of the step's interpolation curve.

### Global Controls

-   The **STEPS** knob
    selects the steps that participate in the sequence.
    Bracket-shaped markers
    surround the _PROGRESS_ lights
    of the selected steps.

-   The **UNI / BI** switch
    selects the range of the anchors' **LEVEL** knobs.

### Outputs

-   **PROGRESS** lights
    at the top of the module
    show the step phase of the active step.
    The color of the light
    progresses from red at step phase 0
    to green at step phase 1.

-   **STEP #**
    identifies the active step,
    represented as \\(\frac{10s}{N}\\) volts,
    where

    - _s_ is the number of the active step
    - _N_ is the module's largest step number

    If every step's phase width is 0,
    the sequencer is paused,
    and the _STEP #_ port emits 0V.

-   **STEP Φ**
    emits a signal that represents
    the step phase of the active step,
    from 0V at phase 0
    to 10V at phase 1.

-   **OUT**
    emits the voltage generated by the active step.
